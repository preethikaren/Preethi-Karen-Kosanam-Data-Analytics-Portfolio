> Project Overview
Human Resource (HR) data analytics plays a crucial role in enabling organizations to make informed workforce decisions. This project, “Unlocking HR Insights,” focuses on analyzing employee attendance data using Power BI to provide meaningful, data-driven insights for HR Generalists and decision-makers. The objective is to transform raw attendance records into an interactive dashboard that highlights attendance trends, sick leave patterns, and Work From Home (WFH) versus Work From Office (WFO) distribution.
Using publicly available real-world attendance datasets, this project demonstrates the practical application of HR analytics to support workforce management, employee well-being, and strategic planning.

> Tools & Technologies
Power BI – Data visualization and dashboard development
Power Query – Data cleaning, consolidation, and transformation
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Creating dynamic measures and KPIs
Microsoft Excel – Source data storage

> Methodology
The project follows a structured data analytics lifecycle:
1. Data Acquisition: Imported employee attendance data from multiple Excel sheets into Power BI.
2. Data Transformation: Used Power Query to clean and consolidate data, unpivot wide-format tables into long format, handle headers, and standardize datasets.
3. Reusable Logic: Created reusable Power Query templates, parameters, and custom functions to automate transformations.
4. DAX Calculations: Developed measures for Present %, Sick Leave %, WFH %, WFO %, and total working days to enable granular analysis.
5. Dashboard Development: Designed an interactive dashboard using card visuals, slicers, tables, and charts for intuitive exploration.

> Key Insights
Identified employee attendance and absenteeism trends
Analyzed sick leave percentages and patterns
Evaluated WFH vs WFO workforce distribution
Supported HR planning and scheduling decisions

> Future Enhancements
Real-time data integration from HR systems
Automated email alerts using Power Automate
Predictive analytics for attendance and attrition
Mobile-optimized dashboard for on-the-go monitoring

> Outcome
This project showcases how data analytics can enhance HR decision-making by providing clear, actionable insights into employee attendance and workforce behavior. It serves as a strong foundation for advanced HR analytics applications.
